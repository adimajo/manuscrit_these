\section{The R Statistical Software}

The vast majority of the code used throughout this manuscript has been done in \textbf{R}. Most experiments can be rerun from the Github repository of the manuscirpt at \url{https://www.github.com/adimajo/manuscrit_these}.

More information about the \textbf{R} Statistical Software, RStudio, and git, which I used extensively during the PhD, can be found respectively in~\cite{}.

\subsection{The glmdisc package} \label{app2:glmdisc}

% Fonctions principales
The glmdisc package can be found on Github at \url{}. It consists in the \textbf{R} implementation of the \textit{glmdisc} algorithm for discretizing continuous attributes, merging factor levels and introducing sparse pairwise interactions proposed in Chapters~\ref{chap5} and~\ref{chap6}.

Once installed, the \textbf{R} help and vignette detail the functioning of the package. Nevertheless, I should mention a few 



\subsection{Miscellaneous}

Apart from the glmdisc package, I produced a package named scoring for the purpose of \textit{Credit Scoring} practitioners, which contains the glmdisc package, the Reject Inference methods discussed thoroughly in Chapter~\ref{chap2} and detailed in Appendix~\ref{app1}, enhances the discretization package containing, among others, the MDLP and $chi^2$ discretization methods to which \textit{glmdisc} is compared in Chapter~\ref{cha5}, and and the model to perform automatic segmentation discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap6}. The scoring package can be found at \url{}.

The figures that were generated by the combined used of \textbf{R} code and the tikzDevice package can be rerun and are located in the R\_CODE\_FIGURES folder of the repository.
